# JSonRetro

JsonRetro is an app that I used to learn about Retrofit and parsing JSon data.
The data retrieved is used to populate a RecyclerView with both TextViews and Android Switches.
I made several iterations here to improve the functionality and readability of the code.
Additional commits were added to fix small instances that I didn't think were in the best
    interest of the user and UI.
I included plenty of log statements so that you can see in the lodCat console what is being retrieved and 
  which switches are available as well as enabled.
  
Thank you for looking.
